# DS3010_CarSale_Project
For our car sales dataset, weâ€™re going to use machine learning to find the most optimal car for each customer based on factors such as the car dealer, manufacturer, model, body style, and the desired price range. Customers prefer different models, body styles, colors of cars, and have different desired price ranges.
